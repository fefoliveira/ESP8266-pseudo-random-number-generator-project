# ESP8266-pseudo-random-number-generator-project
 Simple project made to make the ESP8266 microcontroller generate a pseudo-random number and display it on an eight-segment display, through the loading a C code into the microcontroller and its necessary electronic connections.
 
 You can see the entire project in the simulation made on Tinkercad [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hn9caEbmN48?sharecode=cbTfqJsn5fzH3ZR2SPngAn2VXNlx-InwKBurThk2KHI).   
 Ps.: An Arduino Uno microcontroller was used to make the project on Tinkercad, but in the physical project a ESP8266 was used.
